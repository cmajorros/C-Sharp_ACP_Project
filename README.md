# C-Sharp_ACP_Project
It is stock control c# Application. This system is mainly used in adding stock update and delete items.
I built it last year. I notice that in the business application is usally related to database command.
Some tasks were done repetedly for example in searching product , we use the ID in searching and we also
do this with searching product categories too. Therefore, I try to reduce coding as much as possible. 
I use MySQL for the database, but sorry I could not provide you the database file. This project is the 
an assignment from an employer for testing the new recruitment in C# developer. I still have some bugs in 
deleting the data. 

Best Regards,
Siroros R.
